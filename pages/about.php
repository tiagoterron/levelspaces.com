									<p><strong>LEVEL SPACES</strong> was formed in <strong>April 2018</strong>, back when all the members, even though already friends,  were playing in different projects. Formed by the <strong>Terron</strong> brothers <strong>Lenny</strong> on  the guitar, <strong>Henry</strong> on the bass, and <strong>Guiller</strong> on the cajon, along with <strong>Sonny Klinger</strong> also on the guitar, who  were all back then playing in an acoustic band called <strong>The Red Box</strong>. Meanwhile, drummer <strong>Geraint Morton</strong> was already hitting it with the duo <strong>Buckit</strong>, as well as a parallel hard rock  band, <strong>S.H.O.T.</strong>, with Lenny and <strong>Henry Terron</strong>.<br />
									  <br />
									  It was then that, during a <strong>Northern  Europe</strong> Tour they all did with both bands together on the road, they decided  to join each other and make a single, temporary project out of it. And just  like that, on one sunny day in <strong>Copenhagen</strong>, <strong>LEVEL SPACES</strong> was born. And playing  on the streets under that name was the way to not only complete the ongoing  tour, but also create a special project uniting all of the friends.<br />
									  <br />
									  The public acceptance of that different kind of music was immediate, which  was more reason to, when coming back to their home in <strong>Berlin</strong> in the next month of <strong>May</strong>,  decide to keep going and record their first Demo EP, &quot;<strong>LIVE JAM</strong>&quot;. It consisted of 90% improvisation, that the guys  recorded during a live 1-hour set in their home studio, and set the base for  everything that was coming up!<br />
									  <br />
									  After the release of &quot;<strong>LIVE JAM</strong>&quot;  in <strong>2018</strong>, the band starts to gain a  consistent fan base everywhere they would play, including many regular sessions  in small cities in <strong>Germany</strong>, and  especially in <strong>Berlin</strong>.<br />
									  <br />
									  On the next year, after constant work with experimenting new ideas, they  decide to go back in studio for another hour long jam, again improvising most  of the material, and this time with even more connection, having already been  playing for a year longer. Thus was born their second EP, &quot;<strong>LIVE JAM II</strong>&quot;. Public reception was  just as great, and inspiring to do yet another European Tour.<br />
									  <br />
									  And during the same year, <strong>2019</strong>,  along with their musical evolution and the need for more punch and spice on  their material, came the need for a new member - so they were joined by yet  another <strong>Terron</strong> sibling, <strong>Stefany</strong>, on the electronic drumpads.  Then they were more than ready for hitting the road again, this time going  south, through <strong>Dresden</strong> in Saxony,  then <strong>Prague</strong>, <strong>Vienna</strong>, <strong>Salzburg</strong>, <strong>Venice</strong>, <strong>Milan</strong>, <strong>Florence</strong>, <strong>Bologna</strong>, <strong>Rome</strong>, <strong>Naples</strong>, <strong>Barcelona</strong>, <strong>Madrid</strong>, <strong>Porto</strong>, <strong>Lisbon</strong>, <strong>Sevilla</strong>, as well as <strong>Stuttgart</strong>, <strong>Munich</strong>, <strong>Nuremberg</strong>, <strong>Brunswick</strong> and <strong>Magdeburg</strong>, in <strong>Germany</strong>, until back to <strong>Berlin</strong>.<br />
									  <br />
									  After all those improvised street gigs, spirits were high, because not only  they had traveled more and further than ever together, but also that by then  they had already sold more than 6.000 copies in those 2 short years.<br />
								      <br />
							      And that's not the end of the journey. In fact, it's just the beginning.  The year <strong>2020</strong> is still going to be  full of surprises, starting with the upcoming release of their debut album,  &quot;<strong>UNIVERSO PARALELO</strong>&quot;, in  the month of <strong>April</strong>.</p>
